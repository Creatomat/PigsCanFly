# PigsCanFly üêñ
A minecraft addon that turns you into a pig!  

## What it does?  
It's simple really, all it does is replace the player model and texture with that of a pig!  

## Installation  
Install fabric first, then make sure fabric api, entity texture features, and entity model features are installed.  
Once you're done, you can put this pack into the resourcepacks folder and enable it!  

**Temporary:** Make sure all your skin layers are disabled in the skin customization settings  

## Compatibility
Currently incompatible with every other player related mod, for obvious reasons, these mods only work for the player, not a pig.  
## Known issues
Crouching, Flying, Capes, Swimming, holding items, armor, etc. are all broken right now as this pack is new.  
Should be fixed in the coming month, so please don't report these bugs!
